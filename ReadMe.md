# Notes
- Input validation has not been implemented. Quantity is expected to be always positive
- Quantity is implemented as i64 but in reality it should be Decimal as well
- Unit tests are not implemented, however a main method which test the majority of the scenarios is there
- Did not implement the "string input" from hackerank because of limited value
